# Draughts week 3

Project for first week of Extreme Programming (XP). Starting from the code provided, we should add refactors which improve the maintainability of our project. For the sake of the assessment, a baby-step commit policy has been followed.

Main refactors:

1. Extract a new model `Movement`.
2. Move piece-specific validation logic to `Piece`.
3. Move texts to `MessageView`.
